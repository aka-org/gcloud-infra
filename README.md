# GCP Computing Resources Terraform Modules

This repository used modular Terraform code to provision various resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

It includes:

- üîê Project creation and billing setup
- üõ†Ô∏è API enabling
- ü™£ Bucket and terraform backend creation
- üåê VPC networking and subnet definition
- üî• Firewall configuration for compute engine VMs
- üß± Compute Engine VMs
- üì¶ Modular structure for scalability and reuse

Initial Steps and Bootstrap run:

Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akatsantonis/gcloud_infra.git
```

Export the following terraform variables
```bash
export TF_VAR_project_id="myprojectid"
export TF_VAR_billing_account_id="mybillingaccountid"
export TF_VAR_bucket="mytfstatebucket"
```

Change directory to environments/bootstrap and initialize terraform
```bash
cd gcloud_infra/environments/bootstrap
terraform init
```

You can define variables in:

- terraform.tfvars
- CLI with -var
- Environment variables with TF_VAR_ prefix

See environment/bootstrap/terraform.tfvars for reference.

After configuring the variables run the following
```bash
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan

```

The initial bootstrap will create a Google project associated with a Google
billing account, enable the specified APIs and create the specified buckets.

If you want to use a remote backend for the terraform state, make sure to
set create_gcs_backend to true. This will generate a gcs backend.tf file
without a specified bucket name.

To migrate the terraform state to the bucket that was created, run
```bash
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=${TF_VAR_bucket}" -migrate-state

```

Alternative, you can edit the backend.tf file with the bucket name
and run the above command without setting the -backend-config value.

Type yes when prompted, finish the re-initialization and the state
will be stored remotely.

Provisioning resources to evnironments:

Environments should be placed under gcloud_infra/environments, for
reference checkout environments/testing/

If you created a bucket for remote terraform state storage make sure
to include a gcs backend in the terraform block of main.tf or as a 
seperate backend.tf file under the corresponding environment directory.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "6.8.0"
    }
  }
  backend "gcs" {
  }
...
```

Move to the environment directory and run the following to provision
the resources described in main.tf and configured in terraform.tfvars
```bash
cd gcloud_infra/environments/testing
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```
Checkout environments/testing/terraform.tfvars for example of how to
configure resources such as VMs, subnets and firewall rules.
